    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    
    <div class="experience-item">
      <h3>Solution Intelligence Specialist</h3>
      <span>Apr&nbsp;2023 – Present | TD Bank & Bank of Montreal (Essex Lake Group LLC), New York</span>
      <p>At TD Bank I designed and implemented over fifty controls to detect regulatory and policy breaches in the U.S. credit‑card business, protecting the bank from compliance risks and ensuring operational integrity. Leveraging SAS, Python and SQL, I created reusable code templates that reduced runtime by 40% and manual intervention by 30% while preparing the pipeline for cloud migration to Azure.</p>
      <p>I defined risk thresholds and analysed millions of records to provide leadership with 99% accurate assessments. My work transformed 20+ code runs into a single click process, complete with built‑in quality checks and automated email alerts. I also mentored team members, streamlined data ingestion with advanced SQL macros and sub‑queries, and reduced processing time from six hours to two.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="experience-item">
      <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
      <span>Jul&nbsp;2019 – Aug&nbsp;2021 | Researchwire Knowledge Solutions, Navi Mumbai, India</span>
      <p>Led initiatives to deploy transformer architectures for named entity recognition and question answering tasks, increasing F1 scores and accuracy over baseline models. I orchestrated end‑to‑end machine learning workflows using AWS SageMaker integrated with Lambda, S3 and Glue, improving training efficiency by 60% and saving $50,000 annually.</p>
      <p>I developed QA models that outperformed baselines by 20% by fine‑tuning pre‑trained transformers, and explored reinforcement learning algorithms to deliver robust solutions. My work spanned Python and R and included large‑scale data processing in AWS environments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="experience-item">
      <h3>Data Scientist Intern & ADCS Group Head</h3>
      <span>Jan&nbsp;2018 – Jun&nbsp;2019 | NIT Surat, India</span>
      <p>During my tenure at NIT Surat I engineered a character‑level language model using recurrent neural networks and reduced the vanishing/exploding gradient problem by 25% through gradient clipping. I explored sequential models such as RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs to optimise analysis tasks by 30% and employed Python and R for advanced analytics.</p>
      <p>As head of the ADCS group I led research collaborations, mentored peers and cultivated a culture of innovation across campus.</p>
